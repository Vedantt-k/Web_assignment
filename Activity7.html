            <p>
                Hello! My name is <strong>Vedant</strong>. I am from 
                <span class="highlight"><em>Nanded, Maharashtra</em></span>, and 
                <b>I am a passionate</b> individual who enjoys exploring the world. 
                Through my journey, I want to learn and explore new things
                in various domains, which helps me to constantly evolve and grow.
            </p>

            <h2>Myself</h2>
            <p>
                I have studied at <span class="highlight">GMVV</span> and am currently pursuing 
                an engineering degree from <strong>Vellore Institute Of Technology</strong>. 
                <em>In Engineering</em>, I have always had an 
                <b>interest in CS</b>. I was very fascinated by Technology.
                In today's world, Technology has much importance, so I always 
                wanted to do something in this domain.
            </p>

        <div class="section" style="background-color: #eafaf1; padding: 10px;">
            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I have a keen interest in <strong>Sports</strong>, <em>Cricket and Tennis</em>, and 
                exploring new places, especially the ones that are less explored.
                I also like to spend time in spiritual places, where I find peace.
                I like meditation and always think it provides you the peace to
                look for yourself.
            </p>

            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>
                Apart from all this, my future ambition is to have a 
                <span class="highlight"><b>Masters In USA</b></span>, and eventually 
                becoming an <em>Entrepreneur</em>. I always like to interact with 
                someone who enjoys connecting with like-minded individuals. I firmly 
                believe in the power of collaboration and the impact it can have in achieving 
                remarkable goals. My ultimate aim is to contribute positively to the community 
                and create some impact on the world.
